        rewatching this because I had a real itch to enjoy this perfect season, and
        now that _Better Call Saul_ has it''s last season on netflix, I''m gonna try
        and speedrun through the series'' so I can fully enjoy them... again. \r\nI
        always knew I loved the first season of _Breaking Bad_ when I first watched
        it during my covid infection in January 2022, but rewatching this again just
        really cements it in my mind. What I appreciate the most about season 1 is
        that the whole season just kinda feels like a very long pilot episode. It
        takes its time in establishing our location, the cast and their motivations,
        our characters and what they want, what they need, and what they hopelessly
        fall for. Every major player that stays with us throughout the whole show
        is shown in excruciatingly painful detail, and it changes the game massively.
        Knowing that our characters are just trying to get by, or just not taking
        things seriously, or, in my favorite case, Walter is shown to be the most
        egotistical, borderline-narcissistic piece of shit masquerading as a loving
        father who just wants nothing more than to provide for his family. \r\n\r\nAnd
        I love that, on rewatching, every single thing that is good and bad about
        Walt is shown right at the beginning. You wouldn''t believe that this show
        didn''t have a plan for where it would end up, that it was almost cancelled
        after it''s 3rd season, because everything is not just seamless throughout
        the show, but even from the very beginning the foundations are set in stone
        and followed faithfully.\r\nThe acting is phenomenal and career bests for
        everyone involved, the direction is masterful through every episode of this
        season, and the start of that classic BB style is established and experimented
        with right from the getgo. This is one of my favorite seasons of all time,
        and could absolutely watch this season over and over again.","spoiler":false,"review":true,"parent_id":0,"created_at":"2023-05-29T01:10:23.000Z","updated_at":"2023-05-29T01:10:23.000Z","replies":0,"likes":1,"user_rating":10,"language":"en","user_stats":{"rating":10,"play_count":14,"completed_count":7},"user":{"username":"faustyyyy","private":false,"deleted":false,"name":"fausty","vip":false,"vip_ep":false,"director":false,"ids":{"slug":"faustyyyy"}}},{"id":779878,"comment":"The
        first season of Breaking Bad sets the tone for the show that would come, a
        drama whose action is perhaps outweighs its drama, but always overshadows
        it because of its performances.\r\n\r\nBreaking Bad is nowhere near as successful
        without Bryan Cranston in the role of Walter White. Some of the other casting
        choices (mostly at the recommendation of executives) seem like they could
        play the science teacher but would never be able to pull off the eventual
        drug kingpin already emerging by the end of the first. The rest of the main
        cast feel like they weren’t expected to do heavy lifting early on, except
        Anna Gunn as Skyler and Dean Norris as Hank. Both are veteran character actors,
        and you really feel that experience from them. Aaron Paul, Betsy Brandt, and
        RJ Mitte feel right for their characters but that they still have room to
        grow. They fill that room as the series goes on and the have more and more
        scenes with the more experienced performers. Of the non-recurring actors,
        Raymond Cruz is memorable as drug kingpin Tuco and his experience stands out
        the same way it does with Cranston, Gunn, and Norris. \r\n\r\nThe writing
        on the first season is a little odd, some of which can be assigned to events
        outside its control, others not. The events outside its control being the
        2007-08 WGA strike, which shortened the season from 7 episodes to 9. However,
        it is difficult to imagine how it might have played out over 9 episodes, given
        what we actually saw over 7. The pilot is great, almost a contained telemovie
        that could easily have become legendary had it not been picked up. The second
        and third episodes almost form a two-parter dealing with the fallout from
        the pilot. Then things get a little bit odd and very episodic with episodes
        4 and 5. These give us background of Walt’s career, Jesse’s family, and brings
        Walt’s family up to speed on his cancer diagnosis. It feels like two episodes
        getting us back to a situation we were already at with Walt and Jesse partnering
        up. It brings it back by the end of the first season but overall feels like
        it could have been even a further episode shorter, and we wouldn’t have missed
        much.\r\n\r\nThose first three episodes and last two are also where all the
        action lies in the series. The usage of pop science as a precursor to action
        sequences straight out of an 80s movie would become a hallmark of the series.
        Another hallmark of the series would be the usage of flash forwards to seed
        future events, we see the aftermath of Walt’s blowing up of Tuco’s hideout
        at the start of episode 6 but don’t have the context until the end. This was
        also done in the pilot where we see Walt and Jesse being chased in their RV
        before finding out what’s happening. Some of these hallmarks would wear thin
        as the series went on, but in the first series they still feel warranted and
        not excessive. From the outset, the Albuquerque setting gives Breaking Bad
        a unique look and feel compared with most US television productions filmed
        in either New York City or Los Angeles (and their environs) whether they are
        set there or not.\r\n\r\nThe WGA strike might have helped Breaking Bad, since
        the first season feels tauter (though not without some padding) than it would
        have had it been stretched out. It leaves us wanting more.","spoiler":true,"review":true,"parent_id":0,"created_at":"2025-03-01T22:40:05.000Z","updated_at":"2025-03-01T22:40:05.000Z","replies":0,"likes":0,"user_rating":null,"language":"en","user_stats":{"rating":null,"play_count":7,"completed_count":7},"user":{"username":"RyanAF","private":false,"deleted":false,"name":"ryanafwatches","vip":false,"vip_ep":false,"director":false,"ids":{"slug":"ryanaf"}}},{"id":761243,"comment":"Its

        second episode of Breaking Bad is further proof that the show knows how to

        The tension between his married life and the underworld keeps anyone glued
        to the screen, eager to see how things unravel.\\r\\n\\r\\nWalt and Jesse
        are tasked with getting rid of the bodies of the drug dealers they killed,
        and the situation gets even heavier when they flip a coin to decide who does
        what. The show nails the balance between unintentional humor and brutality.
        Even after deciding to take extreme measures, Walt hasn’t completely lost
        his humanity. Instead of killing Crazy-8 right away, he chooses to give the
        guy a sandwich. These moments highlight how conflicted Walt is internally.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile,
        Skyler is starting to sense that something’s off. She starts digging around
        and ends up finding Jesse, connecting the two parts of Walt’s life that he’s

        raises the bar even higher. It’s a show that constantly challenges the audience
        to understand what’s going on with Walt, and the tension of his choices keeps
        the story exciting and unpredictable. The chemistry between Bryan Cranston
        and Aaron Paul is still spot on, delivering scenes that shift from tragic
        to comedic in a heartbeat, adding even more weight to Walt’s decisions.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor
