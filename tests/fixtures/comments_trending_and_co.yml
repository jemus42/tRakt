        It’s been a long time since *South Park* was bold and biting. The show is
        still topical sometimes, and has the occasional barb to throw at some unwitting
        target despite being in the middle of its third decade on air. But it’s been
        quite some time since the series felt challenging, daring, even a little dangerous.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat
        changed with “Sermon on the Mount”.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly, *South Park* is taking
        direct aim at power again. Suddenly, *South Park* is calling out the President’s
        rank hypocrisy directly again. Suddenly, *South Park* is willing to call out
        its own parent company for knuckling under to censorship and corruption again.
        It’s a fucking breath of fresh air.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s start with the easiest
        point. It’s refreshing and funny to see Matt and Trey set their sights on
        Trump directly with the trademark *South Park* approach. Don’t get me wrong,
        I appreciated the sideways creativity of using Mr. Garrison as the show’s
        vehicle to comment on Donald’s dumbassery. It made the show’s take on Trump
        different than everyone else’s, and occasionally led to [legitimately cutting
        commentary](https://trakt.tv/comments/150894). But different times call for
        different measures, and it’s nice to see the creative changing up their approach
        given the even more blatant bullshit happening in his second term. (Plus hey,
        it’s genuinely nice to see that Garrison’s reformed after the events of [“Spring
        Break”](https://trakt.tv/comments/556773).)\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s one thing to have
        characters simply declare that Donald has turned into a tin-pot dictator straight
        out of the Middle East. It’s quite another for the show to give him the Saddam
        Hussein treatment: the same voice, the same approach to character design,
        the same “gay lovers with Satan” conceit. Reimagining Trump as a modern day
        Saddam is a great way to (a.) pull from the show’s history (b.) demean the
        guy, and (c.) make the commentary that Trump’s a shameless wannabe dictator
        that much more plain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe schtick’s still funny, and for once,
        it feels like the gloves are truly off with the series striking back at Trump.
        Some of that is the show’s usual vulgar touch. The constant references to
        Trump having a tiny penis -- a dig the series previously reserved for Osama
        Bin Laden -- are superficial. (Then again, so is the subject matter.) But
        it’s done in such a direct, constant, and ridiculous manner that it wraps
        back around to being hilarious. Some of it is pointing out the rank hypocrisy
        of Trump claiming the mantle of Christianity and imposing religion everywhere
        he can, while surrounding himself with slags and lechers and acting about
        as ungodly as a person can. Some of it is calling out the bullshit his administration
        is inflicting and promoting directly.\\r\\n\\r\\n*South Park* takes a broad
        approach to that. It’s telling that the denizens of the town all object to
        Trump for different reasons. Randy doesn’t like having religion established
        in his son’s school. Butters’ parents bristle at the idea that you shouldn't
        care about the environment at all. Even the representative of the “Dey took
        er jerbs!” crowd is mad at Trump for just enriching himself instead of doing
        their handiwork. The fact that the citizens of South Park voice complaints
        about Donald’s failing from across the spectrum helps give their criticisms
        power.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut few things are more damning than the show making the
        point that Trump has tried to remake the world in the image of no less a graven
        idol than Eric Cartman.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy god, pointing out the way the way Trump
        has normalized antisemitism, slurs, general hatred, to where Cartman doesn’t
        even know what to do with himself anymore is about as searing a commentary
        on Donald as *South Park* can offer. There’s some genuine pathos in Cartman
        himself feeling lost and listless now that everyone’s acting like him. (Shades
        of [a different episode](https://trakt.tv/comments/829892) from [his old pal](https://trakt.tv/comments/713077)
        Bart Simpson). And there’s plenty of laughs in Eric trying to force his fatalism
        on Butters, replete with a futile attempt at suicide by electric car. But
        the most cutting part of the critique is in the idea that Trump has created
        the kind of country that would give *South Park*’s resident mouthpiece for
        every selfish, harsh, and hateful perspective there is everything he’s ever
        wanted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat's not all the series has in bags of tricks, though.
        *South Park* has offered political commentary, with various degrees of sting,
        for decades at this point. What stands out, and gives the sense that the show
        is back to its roots, is in its willingness to both bite the hand that feeds
        and thumb its nose (or other appendages) at the powers that be.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe
        title of “The Sermon on the ‘Mount” is not just an homage to Christ’s famous
        homily, or an extension of the MAGA crowd strong-arming even the likes of
        PC Principal into forcing Jesus into public schools. It’s a thinly-veiled
        reference to Paramount, *South Park*’s corporate parent, and the way it kowtowed
        to Donald’s bullshit legal claims in order to facilitate a merger. More than
        offering a wide-ranging takedown of Trump, Trey Parker and Matt Stone rail
        against their own corporate bedfellows for censoring, bribing, and capitulating
        to a corrupt President, with a wink and a nod for how it might affect their
        own show.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s one thing to depict *60 Minutes* anchors walking
        on eggshells not to offend dear leader. It’s one thing to depict Trump himself
        that he’ll frivolously bring lawsuits against anyone and everyone for any
        perceived slight, no matter how minor. But it’s quite another to have Jesus
        himself warn the citizens of the town that, the President is suing anyone
        he doesn’t like, accepting bribes in return to mollify him, and wielding the
        power of the state to punish those who won’t.\\r\\n\\r\\nGood lord, it is
        nice to see *South Park* be that transgressive again. It’s nice to see the
        show spoiling for a fight again. It’s nice to see Trey and Matt calling out
        the hypocrisy of those in power and the abject cowardice of the people who
        sign their checks again. It’s nice to see the show itself refusing to back
        down, laying their damning critiques of the President and his enabler bare
        and practically daring Donald or Paramount to do something about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nContrary
        to popular belief, *South Park* didn’t sit on the sidelines for the past decade.
        The show’s boldest and most introspective stretch to date came with season
        20 in 2016, when the show’s creators confronted the role that their work played
        in emboldening trolls and creating a world where someone like Donald could
        be venerated for his mean-spirited cruelty (so long as it was directed at
        the “right people”) rather than summarily rejected. But in the years since,
        its potshots have been haphazard, and its willingness to confront the monster
        it helped create has been sporadic at best, in spite, or because of, the number
        of easy targets he offered.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, finally, it feels like *South
        Park* isn’t pulling its punches anymore. This is the show that took a stand
        against censorship in the face of violent threats. This is the show that challenged
        the famously litigious Church of Scientology to sue over its criticisms. This
        is the show that caused headaches for its network and called the suits out
        directly in its most controversial episodes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an era when everyone
        else seems to be giving into a nakedly corrupt shitstain of a president, when
        the people who speak up like Stephen Colbert get shut down by their corporate
        masters, this series is stepping up. The show’s using its bullhorn to tell
        the world, in more ways than one, that this thin-skinned wannabe emperor has
        no clothes, and doesn’t seem to care about the consequences. For the first
        time in forever, *South Park* feels daring, dangerous, and undaunted again.
        And Jesus Christ, it’s about time.\",\"spoiler\":false,\"review\":true,\"parent_id\":0,\"created_at\":\"2025-07-25T06:13:24.000Z\",\"updated_at\":\"2025-07-25T06:13:24.000Z\",\"replies\":4,\"likes\":27,\"user_rating\":9,\"language\":\"en\",\"user_stats\":{\"rating\":9,\"play_count\":1,\"completed_count\":1},\"user\":{\"username\":\"AndrewBloom\",\"private\":false,\"deleted\":false,\"name\":\"Andrew

        are few films that have had as much of an impact on me as “28 Days Later.”
        I watched it several times in my youth, sometimes three times in a row, and
        I was always thrilled. The film was also instrumental in breathing new life
        into the zombie genre in the early 2000s. The sequel, “28 Weeks Later,” this
        time without director Danny Boyle and screenwriter Alex Garland, was decent,
        but it was also a very conventional take on the genre.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe question
        that most intrigued me before watching “28 Years Later” was definitely what
        prompted Boyle and Garland to return to this world after more than two decades.
        And it quickly becomes clear that they had no interest in retelling the same
        story.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the contrary, “28 Years Later” is refreshingly unpredictable.
        It is primarily a coming-of-age film set in a fascinating world where the
        apocalypse has affected a small part of the globe while the rest of the world
        simply carries on. In 28 years, the infected have evolved, and the survivors
        have developed their own unique structures.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoyle's direction makes
        for a thoroughly captivating film to watch. The editing takes some getting
        used to, but it is also extremely creative, and the landscapes are skillfully
        showcased. The screenplay is also worthy of praise. There is suspense and
        horror as well as a surprising amount of humor, with the plot clearly divided
        into two parts. Alfie Williams plays the lead role in both sections, and the
        young actor delivers an impressive performance. Jodie Comer and Aaron Taylor-Johnson
        are also good, and it should come as no surprise that Ralph Fiennes does a
        great job in his minor role.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat leaves the ending to mention,
        which is sure to divide viewers. The sequel is already reportedly in the can,
        and after this ending, it is likely to take on a very different tone. This
        would be true to the spirit of “28 Years Later,” because the unpredictability
        is what sets the film apart. Ultimately, I am thrilled that a blockbuster
        in 2025 is willing to take such risks.\",\"spoiler\":false,\"review\":true,\"parent_id\":0,\"created_at\":\"2025-06-20T17:48:32.000Z\",\"updated_at\":\"2025-06-20T17:48:32.000Z\",\"replies\":1,\"likes\":26,\"user_rating\":9,\"language\":\"en\",\"user_stats\":{\"rating\":9,\"play_count\":1,\"completed_count\":1},\"user\":{\"username\":\"AlfieSGD\",\"private\":false,\"deleted\":false,\"name\":\"Toralf\",\"vip\":true,\"vip_ep\":false,\"director\":false,\"ids\":{\"slug\":\"alfiesgd\"}}}},{\"type\":\"movie\",\"movie\":{\"title\":\"Happy

        return as Happy feels like catching up with an old mate. He is 60 now, a little
        slower and more serious, and that shift gives the comedy an extra kick for
        those of us who grew up with films like Billy Madison, Waterboy and Big Daddy.
        It is a mix of sharp gags and a touch of melancholy, watching a legend try
        to prove he is still got it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe family angle lands well. His sons
        mirror his old rage and wit, which sparks some of the funniest moments. Julie
        Bowen slips back in seamlessly, now carrying the kind of presence she earned
        through Modern Family. The soundtrack leans on Skynyrd, Tom Petty and other
        rock staples, giving every montage a jolt of energy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen come
        the cameos. Eminem is a riot, Margaret Qualley, Post Malone, Becky Lynch,
        Ben Stiller and Benny Safdie all show up, and golf icons make surprise appearances
        that had the crowd laughing. Shooter McGavin’s reintroduction is a highlight,
        played with gleeful absurdity. The final championship goes completely off
        the rails, think Space Jam chaos, but the film’s heart keeps it grounded enough

        slow-burn, slice-of-life drama about the lasting effects of trauma and the
        agonisingly slow road to recovery. A delightful bit of introspective cinema
        that highlights friendship and platonic intimacy over the usual cliche'd romance

        slowly opening these characters lives through passing dialogue and insightful

        places that aren't so different, even if the path to get there was wildly

        Lawrence and Henry, so much is conveyed with so little and really helps the
        delivery of this sensitive movie. Some will probably bemoan that \\\"nothing
        happens\\\" upon completion of this movie, but I'd argue that is the entire
        point; these characters are contemplating and stewing on what has lead them
        here and how to move on. It is a character first drama, and if you're not
        prepared to sit back and understand the nuances of these people, you'll probably
        have a bad time. For me, this was some stellar drama with a fresh angle highlighting
        friendship instead of romance as the crutch that can keep us going in the
        darkest times in life. It possibly lacks a layer of depth to make it truly
        great, but what there is here is very good stuff for the right audience. Really
        good stuff indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\n--- Spoiler filled musings beyond this point
        that might be off-base ---\\r\\n\\r\\n[spoiler]I'm still trying to fully place
        the metaphor of pools and large bodies of water throughout the movie. I assumed
        they were representive of the brain/mind; gunking up and filling with moss/trash/rubbish
        that life throws in that we must continually clear ourselves of to stay functional
        and clear. Only then, much like at the end of the movie when Lynsey dives
        into the public pool, are we able to dive in amongst everyone else and lead
        a stable life? [/spoiler]\\r\\n\\r\\n[spoiler]The truck is also symbolic of
        Lynsey I suppose, giving herself over to James to work on her while she's
        broken down. The parts to fix her might not be in the town she grew up in,
        but the people can find them from else where to get her back up and running?
        Maybe a stretch but I like it as an allegory. [/spoiler]\\r\\n\\r\\n[spoiler]I
        liked the constant reminder of \\\"matching pairs\\\", with Lynsey playing
        Memory a few times throughout. Lynsey and James obviously being the main matching
        pair, but also their parents, Lynsey and her brother being equally ruined
        by their upbringing, both of them having crutches to deal with everything
        etc. I'd be intrigued to see if there are any other dualities throughout the
        movie to pull out. [/spoiler]\\r\\n\\r\\n[spoiler]It's very obvious but I
        enjoyed how, while Afghanistan and the bombing were obviously the main catalyst
        for Lynsey's issues, it's heavily implied that the unstable, rocky upbringing
        probably had more of a hand in her instability than the IED. While it was
        probably the bomb that demolished the camels back (so to speak), the uneven
        foundation of her childhood clearly made it much harder for her to get back
        on equal footing with no support system in place. As someone with very \\\"hands
        off\\\" parents, this resonated with me more than I expected and made my stomach
        drop a few times during the scenes with her Mom. [/spoiler]\\r\\n\\r\\n[spoiler]Unlike
        other movies, I was also happy to see that the movie was critical of Lynsey
        and her coping mechanism for her trauma too. Many of these drama films only
        navigate the trauma from the perspective of the main character and never usually
        question if their actions are justified or correct. While running away is
        a very easy fix, staying and being compassionate is the harder, but ultimately
        righteous choice that will probably lead to sustained stability and growth.
        We assume Lynsey will run after she/her truck have been fixed, but she finally
        sees that she cannot keep running and must stay to fix the wounds that are
        there. [/spoiler]\\r\\n\\r\\n[spoiler]I look forward to reading all the Reddit
        analysis and essays that come from this movie that prove me wrong or highlight

        something bittersweet—but also very necessary—about the final breakup between
        Carrie and Aidan in this episode of “And Just Like That...,” and the use of
        Taylor Swift’s “How Did It End?” as the soundtrack to that moment is the emotional
        cherry on top: delicate, painful, and ironic. This season built up to that
        ending through some shaky steps and questionable choices, but the resolution
        finally arrives with a kind of honesty that felt lost somewhere between empty
        promises and the couple’s endless cycles. For the first time in a long while,
        Carrie doesn’t just feel frustrated with Aidan—she actually confronts him
        with the strength that had been missing, calling out the absurdity of the
        whole “five-year” plan, the controlling behavior dressed up as love, and all
        his underlying hypocrisy. The confrontation is anthology-worthy, as the series
        purposefully recycles its own memories—from “tense presents” to unresolved
        pasts—finally letting Carrie turn the page for real.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis break
        isn’t sudden; it’s built out of small cracks, and the episode does a great
        job of revealing them bit by bit. The scene where Aidan comments on the smell
        of smoke on Carrie and tells her to take a shower with the coldest contempt
        he’s ever shown? Brutal. Not just because of how he physically repels her,
        but because of everything that cigarette represents—it’s been a symbol of
        her autonomy since “Sex and the City,” and also a tool he’s used to manipulate
        her. The episode lays bare how much resentment Aidan is still holding onto,
        how much control he still tries to wield, and how unwilling he is to fully
        forgive something he claims to have moved past. Carrie, on her end, finally
        realizes she’s been living on his terms, in his timing, making constant compromises.
        She’s not that woman anymore—the one who used to bend herself to make him
        comfortable. When she yells “I was” during the fight, it hits like a punch—because
        she was in it, fully, and he never deserved it.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, the
        episode smartly and subtly brings back that ensemble vibe the show’s always
        done well, giving meaningful little moments to the supporting cast. The conversation
        between Miranda and Joy about alcoholism is uncomfortable, but real—it doesn’t
        sugarcoat or oversimplify what it’s like to live with relapses or personal
        limits. It’s rare to see the show handle addiction with that kind of raw tenderness,
        and it really lands. Seema brings in some comic relief with that ridiculous
        crystal deodorant, a silly little bit that shows how she’s still figuring
        out how to live with someone. And of course, Patti LuPone’s brief but iconic
        return as Gia is a total scene-stealer, with blackmail and a fake accent twist
        that’s both fun and unexpected. Too bad it was so short, though—the potential
        there was huge. Charlotte and Harry’s storyline still has that “geriatric
        domestic chaos” energy, but the affection between them holds up, grounding
        even the more slapstick moments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe episode is full of callbacks
        that, rather than feeling cheap or nostalgic for nostalgia’s sake, actually
        add emotional depth. From the cobbler played by Andy Cohen (a cute nod for
        longtime fans) to the déjà vu argument about who should go cool off outside,
        the script is loaded with winks to those who’ve been around since the very
        beginning. But its biggest win is giving Carrie back to herself. That final
        scene, with her glowing in a white dress, back in her element with the girls,
        is too symbolic to ignore: she’s alive again, vibrant, and finally reconnecting
        with the woman she was before she tried to fit into someone else’s mold. The
        episode is shorter than usual, but it gets that less is more—and that sometimes,
        you need to cut off what’s gone rotten so something healthy can grow again.
        It’s a relief that this cycle with Aidan is finally done—and thank God Carrie,
        like the rest of us, won’t be wasting any more tears on the past.\",\"spoiler\":true,\"review\":true,\"parent_id\":0,\"created_at\":\"2025-07-25T15:02:05.000Z\",\"updated_at\":\"2025-07-25T15:02:05.000Z\",\"replies\":2,\"likes\":5,\"user_rating\":9,\"language\":\"en\",\"user_stats\":{\"rating\":9,\"play_count\":1,\"completed_count\":1},\"user\":{\"username\":\"heyflp\",\"private\":true,\"deleted\":false,\"ids\":{\"slug\":\"heyflp\"}}}},{\"type\":\"episode\",\"episode\":{\"season\":3,\"number\":5,\"title\":\"Tribal\",\"ids\":{\"trakt\":1002079,\"tvdb\":4874873,\"imdb\":\"tt3842948\",\"tmdb\":1016902,\"tvrage\":null}},\"show\":{\"title\":\"Banshee\",\"year\":2013,\"ids\":{\"trakt\":41522,\"slug\":\"banshee\",\"tvdb\":259765,\"imdb\":\"tt2017109\",\"tmdb\":41727,\"tvrage\":null}},\"comment\":{\"id\":716309,\"comment\":\"Random
        thoughts as I watched this episode:\\n\\nHoly shit! They finally changed the
        sad chords! It only took them 25 episodes to finally play a different 4 notes
        when they want the audience to feel sad. I literally said last episode that
        I would stop watching the show if they played the sad chords one more god
        damn time.\\n\\nI've now accepted that this show is 100% satire and can't
        be taken seriously. Sadly, I know that's probably not true, but if it's going
        to be this stupid then at least I can find entertainment in how stupid it
        is. It's equally entertaining to read reviews by people who are truly captivated
        and think this is unironically a great show.\\n\\nAlso, if anyone reads this,
        please watch a minute of any interview or footage of the actor playing Chayton
        (the tribal chief) speaking in his normal voice. It's hilarious. Like, some
        actors are able to pull off fake accents convincingly. But dropping his voice
        several octaves to sound tough? Holy shit, it's just so dumb. His character
        is basically what a three year old imagines as a \\\"bad guy\\\".\\n\\nLastly,
        why Siobhan? Raven was the obvious choice, and/or the former nazi. As other
        reviewers mentioned, Siobhan was the only likable woman in the entire show.
        There were so many other angles they could have taken for the inevitable loss
        in this episode. With that said, I was half expecting her eyes to pop open

        Going into it I thought it'd be a silly unbelievable battle, and the ending
        did live up to that, but overall it was great. The FX and dialogue was perfect
        for once and delivered and left me wanting for more which is a good thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'm
        still left confused with The Third Sister and the point in her [spoiler]attacking

        I did think she had much more depth to her this episode and the last, which
        is great for her and the character but more was needed to salvage the character.
        I feel that actress has a lot more to give but I guess the script didn't offer
        it which reflects bad on her even though it shouldn't.\\r\\n\\r\\nLia was
        in this far less but when on screen it meant something unlike the last episode.
        Great interactions and good acting made her moments very emotional and perfectly

        please go away? I mean, Carrie sometimes had a very strange taste in men (among
        them one very strange  author of I remember this correctly and another guy
        with an exotic accent). I hope that banter and [spoiler]one-night stand[/spoiler]

        her to decorate her home. (and if that all was a token for her current state
        in life [something along the lines that she needed to find a new place in
        life and needed time to fill a void left by her late husband] it was an idea
        they never really capitalized on). PS: the garden design is a disappointment
        too. It also tells you a lot about the show's actual plots. I'm thinking about
        her interior and garden design much more than I'm supposed to. Nothing of
        interest happens otherwise.\\n\\nSteve used to be such a nice guy. He probably
