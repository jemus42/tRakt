        been read harder than when my little brother saw this and said ‘I really liked
        it but YOU’LL love it’. This must be how some trans people felt seeing the
        Matrix, feeling seen, feeling called out, a generational disillusionment and
        a deep dysphoria acknowledged. But The Matrix is a power fantasy by directors
        who love to ape black aesthetics but hold a disdain for us, blame us. This
        is a cautionary tale, one full of empathy but good god I cannot be this.\n\n
        I thought I had scheduled an appointment for this morning to talk to a provider
        about HRT. I spent the previous night wrapped in anxiety about what if things
        go wrong, what if they change for the worse, what if it won’t ’fix’ me, what
        if I talk to these people and they call me out, I’m not trans enough, I’m
        confused. It didn’t go through, I guess. They never called. I scheduled another
        in two weeks, got the email confirmation. And a part of me was relieved. Passed
        the buck down. A misunderstanding I can wash my hands of, a perfect excuse
        I could not be faulted for. \n\nAnd then I saw this. As if to wash the doubt
        away. This hollowed me out. I feel raw and exposed and empty like it dug my
        heart out. I’ve been Owen. I am Owen. I don’t talk right, it’s hard to look
        people in the eyes, my skin doesn’t fit right, I feel hollow and I look in
        the mirror and often I see something disgusting and rotting. Owen in the ending
        is like my biggest nightmare put on screen. I got chicken tenders at the theater,
        I know, I’m a weirdo, and they asked for the name of the order and I used
        my birth name. Here. At no risk to me, nobody who knows me, I still couldn’t
        use Jaycee. I don’t use it at drive throughs. The name I chose, that the people
        I love and trust call me across the internet, that I use on the dating apps,
        I couldn’t use. Why? Because I don’t feel like I’ve earned it? Because it
        doesn’t feel time? There is still time.\n\nI could say more about how this
        hits as someone who grew up on Buffy and Whedon shows for better and worse
        in high school despite being born a year before the show premiered, how it
        hits a nostalgia of a time I knew from behind the screen and then how time
        skips into now, like a shattering of the escape. I could talk about the attachment
        formed to a show before the Internet showed you all the fans who loved it
        like you, seeing yourself in it, projecting onto it what may not be there
        and reckoning with that as you grow. I could talk about Smith’s aching wound
        of a performance or Liddy-Paine’s killer monologue, or the breathtaking lighting
        and cinematography, but all I need to say is what I needed to hear. \n\nThere
        is still time. But that doesn’t mean there’s time to waste. I’m going to do
        that appointment. I’m going to use my name. I’m going to claw to who I want
        to be and who I am inch by inch. And like Owen, I may be alone when I take
        that path but I will be so relieved to be on it, I will know who I am, and
        that will be in part due to seeing the TV glow.","spoiler":false,"review":true,"parent_id":0,"created_at":"2024-05-19T23:27:22.000Z","updated_at":"2024-05-19T23:27:22.000Z","replies":5,"likes":61,"user_rating":10,"language":"en","user_stats":{"rating":10,"play_count":1,"completed_count":1},"user":{"username":"JC230","private":false,"deleted":false,"name":"JC","vip":true,"vip_ep":false,"director":false,"ids":{"slug":"jc230"}}}},{"liked_at":"2023-01-30T20:31:36.000Z","type":"comment","comment":{"id":537743,"comment":"This

        - Sansa\r\n\r\nThey need wheelchair ramps in Winterfell. They left Bran in
        the courtyard overnight!\r\n\r\n==**Parallelism between Season 1 Episode 1
        and Season 8 Episode 1**==\r\n\r\n01. **S01E01** Winter Is Coming. **S08E01**
        Winterfell.\r\n02. **Opening shot** of the **King and Queen arriving** with
        the **same soundtrack** called \"The King''s Arrival.\"\r\n03. **S01E01**
        Winterfell showed grass but **S08E01** it’s covered in snow.\r\n04. The kid
        from the beginning was climbing on trees to get a good view, similar to Bran
        climbing the castle to get a good view. He was made to look similar to Bran
        in the Pilot.\r\n05. Arya being a kid watching the King coming, compare to
        her letting a kid get a good view of the Queen coming.\r\n06. **S01E01** Jamie
        is arriving at Winterfell taking off his Golden Lannister Helmet and showing
        his blond hair, clean shave, and everyone staring at him. **S08E01** Jamie
        arriving in Gray cloaks and taking a hood off to show darker hair and a beard
        and no one except Bran noticing him.\r\n07. Both episodes ending with Bran
        and Jamie, except this time Jamie looks terrified.\r\n08. Both episodes have
        amputated limbs from the white walkers spread out in a gory way to send a
        message.\r\n09. Scenes in the Winterfell crypt except instead of visiting
        Lyanna Stark they are seeing Ned Stark.\r\n10. **S01E01** Cersi and Catelyn
        Stark talk about their kids possibly getting married while looking at them
        from a distance. **S08E01** Varys, Tyrion, and Davos talk about Dany and Jon
        while looking at them from a distance.\r\n11. **S08E01** The reunion of Jon
        and Arya at the Godswood (weirwood tree) is similar to **S01E01** Ned and
        Catelyn at the Godswood.\r\n12. Incest between visiting monarchs and Bran
        watched both lewd acts. Bran controlled the staring scene from Drogon. Another
        interpretation is,\r\n13. Dragon and riders can have personality. Drogon’s
        emotional expression is essentially warning Jon that this is all smoke and
        mirrors (as Varys noted earlier, nothing lasts). The “real” Daenerys is not
        the flirty kissy-face girlfriend joking about eloping; Daenerys’s true nature,
        underneath the playfulness, is reflected in Drogon’s intensity and focus.
        That’s who she is, and Jon shouldn''t forget that.\r\n14. **S08E01** brothel
        scene with Bron is similar to **S01E01** Tyrion’s scene and it is both interrupted
        with someone walking in.\r\n15. **S01E01** Catelyn: \"Where''s Arya?\" \"Sansa,
        where''s your sister?\". Sansa: `¯\\_(ツ)_/¯` **S08E01** Jon: \"Where''s Arya?\"
        Sansa: \"Lurking somewhere.\"\r\n16. **S08E01** Sansa (Current Ruler of Winterfell)
        saying **“Winterfell is yours, Your Grace.”** to the arriving monarch (Daenerys
        Targaryen). **S01E01** Ned (Former Ruler of Winterfell) **“Guarding the North
        for you, Your Grace. Winterfell is yours.”** to Robert Baratheon.\r\n17. **S01E01**
        Robert Baratheon to Ned \"I have a son, you have a daughter, we shall join
        our houses.\" **S08E01** Arya (Stark) and Gendry (Baratheon).\r\n18. **S08E01**
        Sansa being more than wary of Daenerys, similar to Catelyn in **S01E01** was
        of Cersei. She is exactly like her mother (Catelyn) in the greeting.\r\n19.
        **S01E01** Robert asking Ned to be his Hand of the King in the crypts is similar
        to Sam in **S08E01** telling Jon he is the king in the crypts (Hinting Sam
        might become Jon''s Hand of the King).\r\n20. Sam and Ned both share a few
        similarities; Sam is the smarter one in their duo, Sam and Ned''s fathers/brothers
        were burned alive by Targaryens.\r\n21. Jon/Robert - great warriors, “brothers”
        to Sam/Ned, and both seeking for the iron throne but also both doing it for
        reasons beyond wanting the throne (protecting the realm / saving Lyanna and
        removing the mad king).\r\n22. **S01E01** Ned’s farewell to Jon he says **“the
        next time we see each other, we will talk about your mother. I promise.”**
        In **S08E01** Jon is staring at Ned''s tomb while Sam tells him about his
        real parents (Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen).\r\n23. **S01E01** Jon is
        distraught over his identity crisis as a bastard. In **S08E01** Jon is distraught
        over his identity crisis as a king.\r\n24. In **S01E01** Cerci tells Jamie
        to kill Bran. In **S08E01** Cersei tells Bron to kill Jamie.\r\n25. In **S01E01**/**S08E01**
        Arya is jumping into Jon''s arms as he lifts her!\r\n26. **S01E01** A child
        is “dead” and crucified to a tree. Child attacks brothers of the nights watch.
        A brother goes south (then executed by Ned Stark). In **S08E01** a child is
        crucified to a wall. Eddison Tollett (Edd) witnesses, and he goes south to
        warn others. Side note: Opposite of what brother of the Night''s Watch did
        from **S01E01**: safe to say he won’t be executed by Lord of Winterfell considering
        he was one of the reasons the current Lord of Winterfell is alive after himself
        being executed.\r\n27. **S08E01** Daenerys \"The North is as beautiful as
        your brother claimed, as are you.\" Similar to **S01E01** when Cersei said
        \"Hello, little dove.\" \"But you are a beauty\".\r\n28. **S01E01** The last
        time Jon and Arya spoke, she was given her sword Needle and jumped up on Jon
        to hug his neck. **S08E01** Arya jumps up to hug his neck, then shows Jon
        that she still has Needle.\r\n29. If Cersei taught Sansa anything, it''s not
        to blindly trust a beautiful queen coming into Winterfell and promising to
        protect her and fulfill her wildest dreams.\r\n30. **S01E01** The whole family
        standing in line for the king. **S08E01** The remaining Starks and their advisers
        waiting for the queen and Jon\r\n31. In **S01E01** Jon Snow gets a pet Direwolf
        (Stark), in **S08E01** Jon Snow gets a pet Dragon (Targaryen).\r\n32. **S01E01**
        Surprising return of and the existence of dire wolves south of the wall shocking
        the northerners. In **S08E01** The return of and existence of dragons also
        shocking the northerners.\r\n33. The arrival at Winterfell, the only person
        that rode in both caravans, was The Hound. In **S01E01** the hound wore his
        trademark dog helm, but in **S08E01** he wore nothing. It seems to symbolize
        his transition away from The Hound and to being himself, Sandor Clegane.\r\n34.
        In **S01E01** Ned kills the deserter and tells Bran \"the white walkers been
        gone for thousands of years.\" Bran in **S08E01** says we don''t have time;
        the white walkers are coming.\r\n35. **S01E01** Robert and Ned are standing
        in front of Lyanna Stark''s tomb. In **S08E01** Sam and Jon are standing in
        front of Lyanna Stark’s tomb.\r\n36. **S01E01** lady of Winterfell (Catelyn)
        reading a letter by candlelight. **S08E01** The lady of Winterfell (Sansa)
        reading a letter by candlelight.\r\n37. In **S08E01** When Sansa and Tyrion
        were discussing the wedding at Joffrey. Tyrion said \"Last time we spoke was
        at Joffrey''s wedding\" \"Miserable affair\" Sansa said \"It had its moments\"
        recalling Joffrey''s gruesome death and being satisfied by how it went down.
        Recalling \"fondly\" in this instance would be sarcasm.\r\nIn **S01E01**,
        Sansa thinks of Joffrey fondly because she wants to be queen.\r\n38. **S01E01**
        Sandor Clegane comes to Winterfell with the Bastard Joffrey Baratheon. **S08E01**
        Sandor Clegane comes to Winterfell with the Bastard Gendry Baratheon.\r\n\r\n==**Foreshadowing**==
        (from different Seasons/Episodes.)\r\n\r\n`01.` **S03E05**“ “Let’s not go
        back. Let’s stay here a while longer,” Ygritte tells Jon. “I don’t ever want
        to leave this cave, Jon Snow.” **S08E01** “We could stay a thousand years.
        No one would find us,” Daenerys says to Jon.\r\n`02.` Sam is suggesting **rebelling
        against the Targaryen** because they burned his father and brother alive.
        Similar to when **Robert''s Rebellion, began** when **Rhaegar Targaryen**,
        allegedly **abducted** Robert''s betrothed, **Lyanna Stark.**","spoiler":true,"review":true,"parent_id":0,"created_at":"2019-04-15T03:49:07.000Z","updated_at":"2019-04-16T17:07:57.000Z","replies":7,"likes":158,"user_rating":9,"language":"en","user_stats":{"rating":9,"play_count":4,"completed_count":1},"user":{"username":"Cadrieldur","private":false,"deleted":false,"name":"Cadrieldur","vip":false,"vip_ep":false,"director":false,"ids":{"slug":"cadrieldur"}}}},{"liked_at":"2016-07-17T23:51:57.000Z","type":"comment","comment":{"id":89569,"comment":"If
