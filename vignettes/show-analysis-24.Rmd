## Step 1: Search

Use the search function to find the show you're looking for. 
THe show "24" is a particularly good example for a show with a bad name. If we just search for "24", we'll get a completely different show.  
To nudge the search function to find the show we're looking for, we can specify the year of release:

```{r 24-search}
show_info <- search_query("24", years = 2001, type = "show")
show_info
```

Now we have the basic show info to work with, including the `title` and various IDs.


## Step 2: Use the ID

Use the `trakt` ID for subsequent API calls, which is guaranteed to be always available and unique on trakt.tv.  
Now we'll use `seasons_summary()` to get data for all seasons of the show, while also getting an additional list-column containing all episode data, which includes user ratings.

```{r 24-getting-seasons}
seasons <- seasons_summary(show_info$trakt, extended = "full", episodes = TRUE)
glimpse(seasons)
```

## Step 3: Tidying up

We're interested in the `$episodes` list-column, which needs unnesting. In this case we can use `dplyr::bind_rows()` to take the list of `tibble`s and `rbind` them all together, meaning the result is a `tibble` of the episode data we care about.

```{r 24-episodes-unnesting}
episodes <- bind_rows(seasons$episodes)
glimpse(episodes)
```

## Step 4: Graph!

Now we have our episode data in a tidy form, might as well look at it.

```{r 24-episodes-plot}
ggplot(data = episodes, aes(x = episode, y = rating, color = votes)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 2 / 3) +
  facet_wrap(~season, nrow = 1, scales = "free_x") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1, 10, 20), expand = c(0, 3)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 10, .5), minor_breaks = seq(0, 10, .25), limits = c(7, 9)) +
  scale_color_viridis_c() +
  guides(color = guide_colorbar(barwidth = unit(6, "cm"), title.vjust = .75)) +
  labs(
    title = "24: Episode Ratings on trakt.tv",
    subtitle = "Episode ratings by trakt.tv users by season",
    x = "Episode Number", y = "Rating (1-10)", color = "# of Votes",
    caption = "jemus42.github.io/tRakt"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title.position = "plot",
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )
```
