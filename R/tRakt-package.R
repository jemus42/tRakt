#' Pull Data from trakt.tv
#'
#' tRakt is a package that grew out of my initial attempt to compare Stargate SG-1 episode ratings.
#' \href{http://stuff.wurstmannberg.de/tRakt}{Here are some of the resulting graphs}.
#' This package is meant to provide the basic functions required to pull series data, which
#' then can be used either for interactive use and standalone graphs, or for more complex applications.
