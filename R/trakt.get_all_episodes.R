#' Get a show's episodes. All of them.
#'
#' \code{trakt.get_all_episodes} pulls detailed episode data.
#' Get details for a show's episodes, e.g. ratings, number of votes,
#' airdates, images, plot overviewsâ€¦
#'
#' This is basically just an extension of \link[tRakt]{trakt.seasons.season}, which is used in
#' this function to collect all the episode data.
#' If you only want the episode data for a single season anyway, \code{trakt.seasons.season}
#' is recommended, yet this function makes some additions.
#' The use case of this function is to quickly gather episode data of all seasons of a show.
#' @param target The \code{id} of the show requested. Either the \code{slug}
#' (e.g. \code{"game-of-thrones"}), \code{trakt id} or \code{IMDb id}.
#' @param season_nums Vector of season numbers, e.g. \code{c(1, 2)}. If \code{NULL}, all the seasons
#' are pulled by calling \link{trakt.seasons.summary} to determine the number of seasons. If a
#' vector of length 1 is supplied, it is extended to 1:season_nums.
#' @param extended Use \code{full,images} to get season posters. Can be
#' \code{min}, \code{images}, \code{full} (default), \code{full,images}.
#' @param dropunaired If \code{TRUE} (default), episodes which have not aired yet are dropped.
#' @return A \code{data.frame} containing episode details
#' @export
#' @import plyr
#' @note This function is mainly for convenience.
