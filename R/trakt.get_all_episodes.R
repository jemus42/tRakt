#' Get a show's episodes. All of them.
#'
#' `trakt.get_all_episodes` pulls detailed episode data.
#' Get details for a show's episodes, e.g. ratings, number of votes,
#' airdates, images, plot overviewsâ€¦
#'
#' This is basically just an extension of \link[tRakt]{trakt.seasons.season}, which is used in
#' this function to collect all the episode data.
#' If you only want the episode data for a single season anyway, `trakt.seasons.season`
#' is recommended, yet this function makes some additions.
#' The use case of this function is to quickly gather episode data of all seasons of a show.
#' @param target The `id` of the show requested. Either the `slug`
#' (e.g. `"game-of-thrones"`), `trakt id` or `IMDb id`.
#' @param season_nums Vector of season numbers, e.g. `c(1, 2)`. If `NULL`, all the seasons
#' are retrieved by calling \link{trakt.seasons.summary} to determine the number of seasons.
#' If a vector of length 1 (e.g. `5`) is supplied, it is extended to `seq_len(season_nums)`.
#' @param extended Use `full` more data. Can be `min`, `full` (default).
#' @param drop.unaired `logical(1) [TRUE]`: Episodes which have not aired yet are dropped.
#' @param drop.translations `logical(1) [TRUE]`: Remove list-column containing country-
#' codes for available translation. This column is unlikely to be of interest and
#' therefore excluded by default.
#' @return A [tibble][tibble::tibble-package] containing episode details.
#' @export
