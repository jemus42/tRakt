\title{Get a show's season information}
\usage{
trakt.seasons.summary(target, extended = c("min", "full"),
  episodes = FALSE, drop.specials = TRUE, drop.unaired = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{target}{\code{character(1)}: The \code{id} of the item requested. Either the \code{slug}
(e.g. \code{"game-of-thrones"} for a show, or \code{"bryan-cranston"} for a person),
\code{Trakt ID} (e.g. \code{1390}) or \code{IMDB ID} (e.g. \code{"tt0944947"} or \code{"nm0186505"}).
Can also be of length greater than 1, in which case the function is called on all
\code{target} values separately and combined using \link[purrr:map_df]{purrr::map_df} if possible.}

\item{extended}{\code{character(1)}: Either \code{"min"} (API default) or \code{"full"}. The latter
returns more variables and should generally only be used if required.}

\item{episodes}{\code{logical(1) [FALSE]}: If \code{TRUE}, all episodes for each season
are appended as a list-column, with the amount of variables depending on \code{extended}.}

\item{drop.specials}{\code{logical(1) [TRUE]}: Special episodes (season 0) are dropped}

\item{drop.unaired}{\code{logical(1) [TRUE]}: Seasons without aired episodes are dropped.
Only works if \code{extended} is \code{"full"}.}

\description{
Get details for a show's seasons, e.g. how many seasons there are and  how many epsiodes
each season has. With \code{episodes == TRUE} and \code{extended == "full"}, this function
is also suitable to retrieve all episode ratings for all seasons of a show with
just a single API call.
}
\details{
This function wraps \href{https://trakt.docs.apiary.io/#reference/seasons/summary/get-all-seasons-for-a-show}{this API method}
with the endpoint \code{/shows/:show_id/seasons}.
