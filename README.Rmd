`tRakt` helps you to retrieve data from [trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv/), a site similiar to [IMDb](https://imdb.com) with a wider focus, yet smaller user base. The site also enables media-center integration, so you can automatically sync your collection and watch progress, as well as scrobble playback and ratings via [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/), [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/) and the likes.  
And, most importantly, [trakt.tv has a publicly available API](https://trakt.docs.apiary.io) – which makes this package possible and allows you to collect all that nice data people have contributed.

Please note that while this package is *basically* an API-client, it is a little more opinionated and might deliver results that do not exactly match the data delivered by the API. The primary motivation for this package is to retrieve data that is easily processable for data analysis and display, which is why it tries hard to coerce most data into tabular form instead of using nested lists, which is what the direct translation of the API results would look like.

## Installation

Get it from GitHub:

```r
if (!("remotes" %in% installed.packages())) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("jemus42/tRakt")

library("tRakt")
```

## Usage

```{r}
library(tibble) # for glimpse()
library(tRakt)
```

Search for a show, get basic info:

```{r}
show_info <- search_query("Utopia", type = "show")
glimpse(show_info)
```

Get season information for the show using its trakt ID:

```{r}
seasons_summary(show_info$trakt, extended = "full") %>%
  glimpse()
```

Get episode data for the first season:

```{r}
seasons_season(show_info$trakt, seasons = 1, extended = "full") %>%
  glimpse()
```

Or alternatively, get the [trending shows](https://trakt.tv/shows/trending):

```{r}
shows_trending()
```


Maybe you want to know how long it would take you to binge through these shows:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(hms)
library(glue)

shows_trending(extended = "full") %>%
  transmute(
    show = glue("{title} ({year})"),
    runtime_hms = hms(minutes = runtime),
    aired_episodes = aired_episodes,
    runtime_aired = hms(minutes = runtime * aired_episodes)
  ) %>%
  knitr::kable(
    col.names = c("Show", "Episode Runtime", "Aired Episodes", "Total Runtime (aired)")
  )

```


## Credentials

The API requires at least a `client id` for the API calls.  
Loading the package (or calling its functions via `tRakt::` wil automatically set the app's client id (see `?trakt_credentials()`) – for extended use you should set your own credentials via enviroment variables in your `.Renviron` like this:

```sh
# tRakt
trakt_client_id=12fc1de7[...]3d629afdf2
trakt_username=jemus42
```

* `trakt_client_id` **Required**. It's used in the HTTP headers for the API calls, which is kind of a biggie.
* `trakt_username` **Optional**. For functions that retrieve a user's watched shows or stats (`trakt.user.*`), this just sets the default value so you don't have to keep supplying it in individual function calls when you're just looking at your own data anyway.

Please not that there's no client secret listed – that's because this package doesn't implement any authenticated methods. Maybe in the future.

To get your credentials, [you have to have an (approved) app over at trakt.tv](http://trakt.tv/oauth/applications).  
Don't worry, it's really easy to set up. Even I did it.

You theoretically never need to supply your own credentials. However, if you want to actually use this package for some project, I do not recommend relying on my credentials.  
That would make me a sad panda. 
As of now, the trakt.tv API does not have any rate-limiting, but it's not guaranteed to stay like this in the future.
